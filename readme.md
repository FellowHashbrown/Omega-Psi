## Add to Server
If you don't already have Omega Psi in your server, [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=535587516816949248&scope=bot&permissions=519232).

## Make Suggestion or Report a Bug
The nice thing about Omega Psi is that there are two commands specifically for that!
 * `o.suggest` will allow you to make a suggestion for Omega Psi!
 * `o.bug` will let you report a bug in the bot as well!

For both of these commands, as soon as developer marks it as seen, you will be able to be notified of it immediately
 * As long as you allow messages from Omega Psi
 
___
\* - There is a limitation when it comes to creating notifications. Omega Psi can only read a member's presence if the member and Omega Psi have a common guild. Omega Psi will save the guild ID that you run the command in. If the member or Omega Psi leaves that guild, you will have to run the same command in another common server. This is a Discord API limitation and I do not have any control over it.
