Omega Psi Discord Bot
===
[Add Omega Psi to Your Own Server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=535587516816949248&scope=bot&permissions=519232)

The default prefix is `o.` or you can mention it (i.e. `@Omega Psi#0025`). A server manager can change the prefix in case `o.` conflicts with another bot in the server

## Features
There are lots of features in Omega Psi that are useful or simple. Some useful ones are commands like
mathematics commands and coding commands.

There are also minigames you can play in the bot either against an AI, against real people, or a mixture of both!
 * Uno, the Game of Life, and Tic Tac Toe are some games you can play against an AI or with real people.

If you'd like to take a look at a full list of commands, Omega Psi's [website](https://omegapsi.fellowhashbrown.com)
has a list of commands and any subcommands in it.

## Server and User Management

### Server Managers
* As a server manager, you can choose what commands to enable or disable using the `enableCommand` and `disableCommand` commands.
    * Note that you *cannot* disable the `help` command. That would completely unhelpful to your server's members
    * You can also change the prefix for your server.
        * Note that if you change the prefix to something that ends in a letter or a number, you will need to add a space when calling a command (which makes sense)

### Members
* As a member in a server, you can change only one thing at the moment
    * Using the `setEmbedColor` command (shorthand `embed`), you can change the color of the embed when running commands. It is not server-specific either

In addition, you can also use [Omega Psi's website](https://omegapsi.fellowhashbrown.com/settings) to configure your server or yourself.

## Bugs and Suggestions

### Bugs
Whenever you report a bug, either on the website or in the bot (using the `bug` command), you will be asked for where the bug happened (either the `bot` or the `website`)
and where specifically the bug happened (either a `command` or a `page`)

### Suggestions
Whenever you'd like to make a suggestion, you can do so either on the website or in the bot (using the `suggest` command).

Once you report the bug or submit the suggestion, you can then view them using the `myBugs` or `mySuggestions` command so you can see if your
bug report or suggestion has been seen, fixed, or considered.
**Note that if a developer does not consider your suggestion but then later reconsiders it, you will be notified of that too. This is not a bug.**

Whenever a developer marks your bug or suggestion as seen, you will be notified through Omega Psi **_but you must allow Omega Psi to send you messages for this to work_**
Otherwise, you will have to view the *bugs* or *suggestions* channel or use the `myBugs` or `mySuggestions` command to stay updated on whether or not your bug has been seen
