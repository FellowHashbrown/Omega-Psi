Omega Psi Discord Bot
===
[Add Omega Psi to Your Own Server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=535587516816949248&scope=bot&permissions=519232)

The default prefix is `o.` or you can mention it (i.e. `@Omega Psi#0025`). A server manager can change the prefix in case `o.` conflicts with another bot in the server

## Features
There are lots of features in Omega Psi that are useful or simple. Some useful ones are commands like
mathematics commands and coding commands.

There are also minigames you can play in the bot either against an AI, against real people, or a mixture of both!
 * Uno, the Game of Life, and Tic Tac Toe are some games you can play against an AI or with real people.

If you'd like to take a look at a full list of commands, Omega Psi's [website](https://omegapsi.fellowhashbrown.com)
has a list of commands and any subcommands in it.

## Bugs and Suggestions

If you find any bugs in the bot or if you'd like to make a suggestion, you can do that in one of two ways:
 * Use the commands in the bot (`o.bug` or `o.suggest`) to report a bug or make a suggestion
 * Head on over to the [info](https://omegapsi.fellowhashbrown.com/info) page on Omega Psi's website to report a bug or make a suggestion
    * `NOTE: You will have to authenticate yourself through your Discord account when loading this page. This is used to be able
    to notify you whenever your bug report or suggestion has been seen.`

Whenever you report a bug or make a suggestion, you're given a case number as well which you can use, if your bug or suggestion has gone unnoticed for
an extended period of time, to contact a developer and reference your case number.
