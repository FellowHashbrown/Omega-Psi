## Add to Server
If you don't already have Omega Psi in your server, [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=503804826187071501&permissions=0) is a basic link (no permissions) you can use.
If you want a custom permission integer, you can use the `omega invite` command to do that. You can customize all aspects of the bot's control. (Just try it out)
