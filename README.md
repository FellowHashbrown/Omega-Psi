# omega-psi-py
A Discord Bot with all kinds of commands split up into modular categories. Open to command requests and feature requests.

## What does it include?

### Prefix: `omega`
  For right now, the prefix cannot be changed for an individual server. However, that will be implemented soon.
### Fun Commands:
 * Gifs
 * Insults
    Note: Any NSFW insults will only be sent in an NSFW channel. There is no way around this.
 * Math Functions
 * Leveling

### Server Moderation Commands:
 * Add/Remove Roles
 * Give/Take Member's Roles
 * Set the name of the Server
 * Create an Instant Invite
 
 Note: Omega Psi *must* have the respective permissions to run some of the server moderation commands.
 
### Other Commands:
  There are more commands that pertain to the bot's moderation in a server:
   * Setting someone's leveling for the leveling system
   * Adding a Server Moderator
   * Activating/Deactivating Commands
   * Toggling Leveling
   * Toggling a Welcome message

**By default, the leveling system and the welcome messages are disabled.**

# Bot Moderation
If you fork this bot and want to become a bot moderator, let me know and I will get back to you.
Bot moderation will *not* be granted to just anyone.
